## pepADMET: a novel computational platform for systematic ADMET evaluation of peptides
## Aims
pepADMET is a comprehensive AI-driven platform for predicting absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) properties of peptides. Designed for pharmacologists and clinicians, it accelerates peptide-based therapeutic development.
## Explanation about the files

### toxicity_early_stop.pth: 
pre-trained predictive model that can be directly loaded for toxicity prediction. The model include trained network parameters and necessary configuration details, allowing users to perform inference without retraining.
